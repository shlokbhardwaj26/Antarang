# Antarang
“Antarang” means inner feelings and emotions. We are trying to understand user needs by their emotions. Our project Antarang involves a user interface for interaction and emotion recognition using AI technology. Our AI model will be trained, fine-tuned, and integrated into the user interface so that it can respond according to detected emotions
