# Antarang
“Antarang” means inner feelings and emotions. We are trying to understand user needs by their emotions. Our project Antarang involves a user interface for interaction and emotion recognition using AI technology. Our AI model will be trained, fine-tuned, and integrated into the user interface so that it can respond according to detected emotions
There is one more factor that it takes into account, which is the user's age. It is an important factor to be taken into consideration in sensitive topics like mental health. With the help of these two factors, we can generate a response that is more accurate and fulfilling to user needs. Unlike other platforms, you will get an experience which is tailored according to you and your mood. We are trying to provide a safe and personalized environment where you will get the advice or help that you require, which is also appropriate for your emotional state and age.
